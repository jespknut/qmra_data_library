# qmra_data_library
This repository contains a curated and structured data library supporting Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA). It includes:

Pathogen occurrence data (raw concentrations) across various water matrices

Exposure parameters for different activities and pathways

Dose-response model parameters for key pathogens

Treatment log reduction values for multiple processes

Complete reference metadata with DOIs and links for traceability

The data is stored in machine-readable CSV files and accompanied by scripts for loading and validating data. All datasets are version-controlled for transparency and reproducibility, supporting research and risk analysis applications.

Contributions and feedback are welcome!
